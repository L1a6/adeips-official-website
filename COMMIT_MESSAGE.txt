###  Critical Bug Fixes

#### Enrollment System

#### Supabase Integration

- Added server-side check for service role key (`typeof window === 'undefined'`)
- Changed admin blog page from direct Supabase calls to API route fetch
- Proper separation of client-side (anon key) vs server-side (service role) operations

#### SQL Database
